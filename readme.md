## Problem Statement: Data-Driven Decision Making for Sectoral Optimization

As final-year software engineering students, you are required to demonstrate how data analytics can be leveraged to solve real-world organizational challenges. You are tasked with selecting a unique dataset from a domain of your choice (e.g., Retail/Business, Healthcare, Finance, Telecommunications, or Smart City Infrastructure).

Your goal is to analyze the data to identify bottlenecks and propose actionable strategies—such as increasing business revenue, optimizing hospital patient flow, or improving customer retention.

### Phase 1: Dataset Acquisition and Understanding
* **Dataset Selection:** Choose a dataset with at least 500 rows and 6+ variables.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure correct data types for each column (e.g., converting strings to dates).
* **Data Dictionary:** Define each variable and its importance to the business/organization.

### Phase 2: Analytics Tasks

**1. Descriptive Profiling & Distribution Analysis**
* Calculate the Central Tendency (Mean, Median) and Dispersion (Standard Deviation, Range) for key metrics.
* Visualize the distribution using Histograms and Box Plots. Identify if the data has outliers (e.g., unusually high medical bills or extreme sales days) and explain how these outliers affect the "average" performance.

**2. Comparative Segment Analysis**
* Group your data by categories (e.g., "Performance by Gender," "Sales by Region," or "Patient Recovery by Age Group").
* Use Bar Charts or Pie Charts to compare these segments. Identify which segment is underperforming and suggest a reason based on the data.

**3. Probability & Normality Assessment**
* Identify a key variable that follows a Normal Distribution.
* Using the Mean and Standard Deviation, calculate the probability of a specific event occurring (e.g., "What is the likelihood a customer spends more than 5000 PKR?" or "What is the probability a delivery takes more than 3 days?").

**4. Strategic Recommendations**
Based on your findings above, you must provide at least three suggestions to improve the organization. These cannot be generic; they must be backed by your data results.
* *Example (Business):* "Our correlation analysis shows a 0.85 relationship between 'Evening Hours' and 'High Sales.' I suggest increasing staff by 20% during 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM to maximize growth."
* *Example (Hospital):* "The Box Plot reveals that 15% of patients wait over 2 hours in the Emergency Ward. To improve customer care, the hospital should implement a digital pre-triage system to sort minor cases faster."

### Objectives
1. To demonstrate the ability to clean, process, and visualize real-world datasets.
2. To apply statistical inference to make data-backed engineering and business decisions.
3. To communicate technical findings through a structured professional report.

### Deliverables
1. **Project Code:** (Python/Jupyter Notebook) showing the analysis.
2. **Final Technical Report:** A comprehensive document detailing:
    * Introduction to the chosen domain.
    * Data Dictionary (explanation of features).
    * Statistical findings and visualizations.
    * Management Summary: 3-5 actionable recommendations to improve the business/service based on your data findings.

### Attributes Conformance

| Sr.# | Attribute | Status | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Range of resources** (resources include equipment, materials, information and technologies) | **Yes** | This problem requires students to independently source, evaluate, and synthesize diverse datasets from global repositories (Kaggle, UCI, or real-world entities). Students must employ advanced data management technologies such as Python (Pandas/NumPy) or Excel, using statistical libraries to handle complex data structures, making sophisticated resource management a core component of the activity. |
| **2** | **Level of interaction** (Require resolution of significant problems arising from interactions between wide-ranging or conflicting technical, engineering or other issues) | **Yes** | Students must navigate the interaction between conflicting variables—such as minimizing operational costs while maximizing customer care quality. These interactions pose significant engineering challenges, as students must find an optimal balance between resource constraints and performance targets, reflecting real-world engineering problem-solving where competing priorities are common. |
| **3** | **Familiarity** (Can extend beyond previous experiences by applying principles-based approaches) | **Yes** | This CEA transcends standard textbook exercises by requiring students to apply fundamental data analytics principles to uncharted, real-world scenarios. By selecting their own domain, students move beyond rote learning to a principles-based approach, applying diagnostic analytics to solve practical problems that extend their technical skills into professional engineering contexts. |
| **4** | **Innovation** (Involve creative use of engineering principles and research-based knowledge in novel ways.) | **Yes** | By transforming raw data into a "Strategic Improvement Plan," students must creatively interpret statistical trends ($r$-values, slopes, and distributions). Proposing specific, data-backed suggestions to grow a business or improve hospital services showcases innovation, as it requires the novel application of engineering knowledge to optimize organizational efficiency and human-centric services. |
